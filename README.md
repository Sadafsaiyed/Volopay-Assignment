* The following assignment consists of a frontend application using React. Where I have created a web application which is user friendly in which user can decide it's status whether it is active or inactive depending on the card type, i.e. either BURNER or SUBSCRIPTION.
* We have also designed a JSON structured API, which includes all the necessary details required for the card type, and to know which one is running depending on the owner_id.

The navbar of my application consists of 3 tabs which are-
1. YOUR-
In the 'your' page we are showing the recent active card of the user, which is currently working.

2. ALL-
In the 'all' page we are showing all cards which are available i.e. either burner or subscription and user can choose any one depending on their choice.

3. BLOCKED-
In the 'blocked' page further, the cards that will be blocked, or get expired will be displayed.

* The user can filter by card type as well, depending upon the type i.e. either burner or subscription.
